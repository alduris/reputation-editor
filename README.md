# Reputation Editor for Rain World
Adds a command via [Dev Console](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/DevConsole) to view and modify reputation.

## Usage
While the console is open, use the `reputation` command with the following parameters:
- Mode: either `get` or `set`
- Community: any in-game creature community, such as Scavengers.
- Region (optional): the region acronym. If left blank, uses global reputation.
- Value (required if `set` mode): the value to change it to, between -100 and 100.
